# micro-ressort

Static website.

This is currently an initiative to move the content of the first brochure of the non-profit association micro-ressort into a simple website.

micro-ressort is dedicated to help administratively and provide loans to disadvantaged people to allow them to reach their life goals (studies, jobsâ€¦).

## Roadmap

- set build tasks to minify, compress files etc. (not set to avoid complexity if another person join the project).
- if build tasks are defined, set the github page source on another branch than master.
